Explanation of Key Files and Folders:
.env: This file is where you will store your sensitive information like REACT_APP_JIRA_EMAIL, REACT_APP_JIRA_API_TOKEN, and REACT_APP_JIRA_DOMAIN. Remember, it must be at the root of your project and start with REACT_APP_ for React to pick it up.

.gitignore: This file prevents your .env file from being pushed to public repositories like GitHub. Always ensure .env is listed here.

src/App.js: This file would contain the main structure of your dashboard, including the state management and the overall layout. It would import Card and Button from src/components and delegate the actual Jira API calls to a function imported from src/api/jira.js.

src/components/: This directory holds all your reusable UI components (Card, Button, and any others you might create, like a Modal for request details if it gets more complex than what's currently in App.js).

src/api/jira.js (Recommended Addition): While App.js can contain the fetchData function, for better organization, especially as your application grows, it's a good practice to move all your API interaction logic into a separate file like src/api/jira.js. This file would then be responsible for reading the process.env variables and constructing the actual fetch requests.

This structure allows for a clean separation of concerns, making your project easier to manage, scale, and secure.
